A Shopify theme development tool.

## Features

- Supports uploading to multiple Shopify stores and themes
- Easy to use configuration wizard
- Uploads/downloads in parallel greatly reducing transfer times
- Supports autocompiling scss locally before uploading to Shopify

## Installation

##### TL;DR;

`npm install -g quickshot`

##### Verbose

Quickshot is written in Iced CoffeeScript and runs on node.js and io.js.

If you have neither of those installed visit https://nodejs.org/download/

After installing one of the above, open a terminal and run `npm install -g quickshot`

If you have errors, you may need to run the above command with `sudo`. Try `sudo npm install -g quickshot`

# Getting started

## The configuration wizard

The configuration wizard will guide you through creating your quickshot.json file. **You do not need to make or edit this file by hand!** (but you certainly can if you wish).

*Also note the configuration wizard is designed be run multiple times. If you want to change your configuration, just run it again!*

Navigate to the directory where your theme files live, or where you'd like them to be, and execute the following command:

`quickshot configure`

After the wizard starts you will be shown options for managing `targets`

#### Whats a target?

A `target` is a specific theme at a specific shop. Here are some examples of different targets you could make.

- a theme called `shoe store test` at `dev-shoe-store.myshopify.com`
- a theme called `staging shoe store` at `shoe-store.myshopify.com`
- a theme called `production store` at `shoe-store.myshopify.com`

You will need to get Shopify Private App Credentials for each store you want to target.

#### Getting Private App Credentials

Go to **your-store.myshopify.com**/admin/apps/private in your web browser. Click on “Create a Private App” to generate the credentials for a new app. You will need the API Key and Password of this newly generated app:

### Creating targets

After executing `quickshot configure` you will be presented with the following menu:

```
? Main Menu: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Configure targets
  Configure sass
  Configure ignore file
  Save configuration and exit
```

To configure your targets select "Configure targets" using your arrow keys and press enter. You will then see the following menu.

```
? Manage Targets: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Create Target
  Edit Target
  Delete Target
  List Targets
  Done Managing Targets
```

Select `Create Target` from the menu using the arrow keys.

You will then be asked for all of the following information:

- **Target Name** *Staging, Development or whatever you wish*
- **API Key** *Copied from the private app settings page on Shopify*
- **Password** *Copied from the private app settings page on Shopify*
- **Store URL** *URL to the shopify store you want to connect to*
- **Theme** *quickshot will display all the available themes from your shop, use your arrow keys to select which one you want to connect to*

When the configuration wizard asks `Would you like to enable automatic compiling for scss files?` press `y`. You will then be asked for the relative path to the file you wish to be compiled automatically. If you are unsure, accept the default. **Further information on scss autocompiling is detailed below.**

After configuring a target, you are returned to the main menu. From there you can edit, delete, and display a list of all configured targets. If you are finished adding targets select `Done Managing Targets` to continue.

## Commands

Executing `quickshot help` at any time will provide an overview of the available commands:

```
  quickshot configure              Creates/Updates the configuration file in current directory
  quickshot download [filter]      Download theme files, optionally providing a filter
  quickshot upload [filter]        Upload theme files, optionally providing a filter
  quickshot watch                  Watch project folder and synchronize changes automatically
  quickshot --help                 Show this screen.
```

## Ignore file(s)

After executing `quickshot configure` and selecting `Configure ignore file` you will be presented with the following menu:

```
? What would you like to use as the quickshot ignore file? (Use arrow keys)
❯ .gitignore
  .quickshotignore
```  

You may want to ignore files such as `settings_data.json` which contain data that could have been edited via Shopify's web admin panel that you don't want to overwrite using commands like `quickshot watch` (especially when working in multiple stores). 

# Autocompiling scss

Quickshot has the ability to compile scss before uploading to Shopify. This can make your workflow easier, and keep your pages loading fast by only needing to include one css file in `theme.liquid`.

## General Usage

**These instructions assume the default settings were used**

For this example lets assume you have 3 css files in your project.

```
main.css
navigation.css
typography.css
```

After running the `quickshot configure` we now have

```
application.scss
main.css
navigation.css
typography.css
```

Rename all your css files to have a `.scss` extension

```
application.scss
main.scss
navigation.scss
typography.scss
```

Then edit your `application.scss` similarly to below.

```scss
@import "main";
@import "navigation";
@import "typography";
```

When compiled this will create one `application.css` file containing all your merged css styles. Now we just need to include this in our `theme.liquid` file.

```html
<!doctype html>
<head>
    <!-- application.css is recompiled and uploaded anytime you change ANY .scss file in your project. -->
    {{ 'application.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}

    {{content_for_header}}

</head>
```

After that you can use all the benefits of scss! For more information on what you can do check out the [Sass documentation](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE)
